If you are running Windows 95/98/Me or Windows NT 4 a fax printer cannot be automatically
installed by the YajHFC setup program.


Please follow the instructions given at http://yajhfc.berlios.de/doc/winfaxprinter.html
to install a fax printer.


Note:
The steps 1 (install YajHFC) and 2 (download & install redmon)
have already been performed by this setup program.
