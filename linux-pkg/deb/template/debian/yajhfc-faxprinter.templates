Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: Automatically start YajHFC on login?
 For the fax printer to work YajHFC must be running when the user prints to it.
 .
 Selecting yes for this option adds an entry to /etc/xdg/autostart to make sure YajHFC
 is automatically started when starting most desktop environments.
 You can later change this using dpkg-reconfigure if you want.
