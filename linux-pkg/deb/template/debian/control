Description: Install a virtual fax printer for YajHFC
 This package installs a virtual fax printer in CUPS for YajHFC.
 .
 When a user prints to this printer, the output is redirected to YajHFC and
 a "send fax" dialog is shown.
 .
 YajHFC must be running when a user wishes to print to the virtual fax printer.
 Because of that, this package automatically adds an autostart link for all 
 desktop environments conforming to the Free Desktop Menu Specification (e.g. KDE, GNOME, XFCE).
