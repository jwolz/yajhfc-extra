YajHFC & CUPS
=============

This document describes how you can create a "fax printer" in CUPS
that uses YajHFC as frontend.

1. Install YajHFC and sudo.

2. Modify the settings at top of the "hylafax" script in this archive to use the 
   correct paths.
   Use/create some unpriviledged user with a writable home directory as DEFAULTUSER.
   (DEFAULTUSER is used only in rare occasions, e.g. when submitting a test page from
   the CUPS web frontend)

3. Copy the "hylafax" script to the CUPS backend directory (usually /usr/lib/cups/backend)
   and make sure it's executable (e.g. "chmod 0755 /usr/lib/cups/backend/hylafax")

4. Copy the "hylafax.ppd" file to the CUPS model directory (usually /usr/share/cups/model)

5. Find out under which user ID the cups daemon is running.
   To do so, enter "ps aux|grep cupsd" in a console, the first column will contain the user name
   of the daemon (usually root or something like "cupsd").

6. If the cups daemon is running as root, go to step 7.
   Else, you'll have to edit the sudo configuration file:
   As root, enter "visudo" in a console, then paste the following configuration lines in and modify
   them according to the comments:

## begin YajHFC config
# Replace "cupsd" with the user name cupsd is running under
User_Alias CUPSUSER = cupsd
# Replace "user1, user2, user3" with the users who should be allowed to send faxes
Runas_Alias FAXUSERS = user1, user2, user3
# Replace with the path to the java executable
Cmnd_Alias FAXCOMMANDS = /usr/bin/java
# Do not modify the next line
CUPSUSER ALL=(FAXUSERS) NOPASSWD:FAXCOMMANDS
## end YajHFC config

7. Restart CUPS and use the web interface to add a new printer with the device 
   "Local Hylafax server" and model "Hylafax".

8. Enjoy!

NOTE: 
Do not use the CUPS test page to test the script. It doesn't send a username to run YajHFC under,
so the DEFAULTUSER is used who often doesn't have the rights to access the X server.
